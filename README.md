# About the project

This project is my own interpretation of the Search for a Star 2019 competition. I tried to stay true to the base project as provided by the Search for a Star staff.

# Structure of this repository

At the start of the project, all commits went into the main branch. This was convenient and worked quite well. However, as the project grew and became more complex, it became apparent that the project was in need of a better structure. I should have done this right at the start of the project...

## Branches

The project uses three "main" branches:

- Master: contains the latest **stable releases**, does not update frequently.
- Development: works most of the time and is **updated at the end of each sprint**.
- Experimental: **brand new features** are pushed to this branch.

## My workflow

1. Clone the project to my local drive.
2. Pull latest changes.
3. Create a branch on the **experimental** branch named the same as the feature that will be added to the project.
4. Once the feature works as intended, it is merged into the **experimental** branch.
5. At the end of the sprint, the **experimental** branch is **merged** into the **development** branch.
6. The changes on **development** are pushed to **master** as soon as I feel like they drastically changed the experience of the player.
