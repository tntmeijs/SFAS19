# About the project

This project is my own interpretation of the Search for a Star 2019 competition. I tried to stay true to the base project as provided by the Search for a Star staff.

# Structure of this repository

At the start of the project, all commits went into the main branch. This was convenient and worked quite well. However, as the project grew and became more complex, it became apparent that the project was in need of a better structure. I should have done this right at the start of the project...

## Branches

The project uses three "main" branches:

- Game release: contains the latest **stable releases**, does not update frequently.
- Development: **brand new features** are pushed to this branch.

## My workflow

1. Clone the project to my local drive.
2. Pull latest changes.
3. Create a branch on the **development** branch named the same as the feature that will be added to the project.
4. Once the feature works as intended, it is merged into the **development** branch.
5. The **development** branch is **merged** into the **features** branch once the feature works properly.
6. The changes on **features** are pushed to **release** as soon as the build is stable and has enough feature to consider it a big update of the game.
